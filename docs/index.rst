What is RTPEngine?
=====================================

The `Sipwise`_ NGCP RTPEngine is a proxy for RTP traffic and other UDP based media traffic.
It's meant to be used with the `Kamailio`_ SIP proxy and forms a drop-in replacement for any of the other available RTP and media proxies.

Currently the only supported platform is GNU/Linux.
